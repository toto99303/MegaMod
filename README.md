# MegaMod
These are the three versions of MegaMod PCB for Sega Genesis.
Created with Eagle PCB.

v1 - uses PIC16F630 (https://vmod.wordpress.com/megamod-v1-0/)  
v2 - uses Atmega328P with internal oscillator (https://vmod.wordpress.com/megamod-v2-0/)  
v3 - uses Atmega328P with internal oscillator + THS video amp (https://vmod.wordpress.com/megamod-v3-0/)

PIC code used in v1: https://github.com/sebknzl/saturnmod

The Arduino code for v2 and v3 was based on this project:
https://github.com/SukkoPera/MegaDrivePlusPlus

Due to some bugs related to the Atmega328P internal oscillator the Arduino code was never finished.
